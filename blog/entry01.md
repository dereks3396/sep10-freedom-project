# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Wireless)
##### 10/7/24

**SEP Freedom Project**

# **Choosing a topic**

I decided to choose *wireless technology* for my project because I’ve always found it interesting how things like phones, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth work without any wires. I also thought about doing telecommunications or industrial automation, but wireless technology seemed more exciting since it’s used in so many areas, like smart homes and healthcare. I want to explore how this technology works and how it’s making our lives easier. Some of the articles I will use to help with my research are [Wireless Networks: Understanding your Wireless Connection](https://www.ruckusnetworks.com/insights/wireless-networks-understanding-your-wireless-connection/), [Overview of Wireless Networks](https://utsa.pressbooks.pub/networking/chapter/overview-wireless/), and [What Is a Wireless Network? - Wired vs Wireless](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/wireless-network.html). These will give me a better understanding of the basics of wireless networks and how they compare to wired ones.

# What I need to Work on

## Time Management

It has been a little hard to manage this project with everything else I have going on. I have homework and chores at home. To stay on track, I decided to work on the project every weekend. Having a set time makes it easier to focus and get things done. I also try to use some free time during the week, like school breaks to work on parts of the project. This way I won’t feel rushed later, staying organized is important because I want to do well on this project without falling behind on other things.

## Research Skills 

I’m getting better at finding useful information online. At first, I searched for broad topics like *wireless technology*, but I got too many results that didn’t help much. Now, I search for more specific things like *wireless networks overview* or *wireless vs wired connections*. This gives me better answers and saves time. Now I also read quickly through articles to see if they are useful instead of reading every word. Using the right keywords makes a big difference. I realized good research is not just about finding lots of information but about finding the right information.
