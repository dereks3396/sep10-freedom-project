## Wireless Devices: How They Connect Us

### Introduction
In this blog, I'm learning about wireless devices—like phones and smart home gadgets—and how they connect to each other. Wireless devices make it possible for us to communicate and access information without wires. This entry is based on three resources: [How Wireless Works](https://howwirelessworks.ctia.org), [Explained: How does wireless work?](https://www.grandmetric.com/explained-how-does-wireless-work/), and [What Is a Wireless Network or Wi-Fi?](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/wireless-network)

### Resources Explored
The first article, [How Wireless Works](https://howwirelessworks.ctia.org), explains how data moves from one device to another through a wireless network. For example, when we send a message from a smartphone, the data travels through different stops—like cell towers and routers—before it reaches another phone or device.

The second article, [Explained: How does wireless work?](https://www.grandmetric.com/explained-how-does-wireless-work/), talks about how wireless signals are created. It explains that signals start from a tiny part in a device called an "oscillator," which creates waves that move through the air. These waves carry data and use different "frequencies" (or specific airwaves) to keep from interfering with other signals.

The third article, [What Is a Wireless Network or Wi-Fi?](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/wireless-network), explains how Wi-Fi works. Wi-Fi is a type of wireless network that lets us connect to the internet in our homes, schools, and other places. It uses certain frequencies, like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, and works like a "traffic system" so multiple devices can connect at the same time.

### Skills Gained
This research helped me understand how wireless networks work in simple terms. I learned about different types of wireless networks, like small networks (LAN) and larger ones (WAN), which allow us to connect in different places. I also learned about the important parts of wireless networks, like cell towers and antennas, which help send signals from one device to another. Now, I have a better idea of how wireless devices keep us connected without needing cables.
