| Alberto     | I like the color template that you are using for your website as well as the images' responsiveness.  | Did you think about having the software, hardware, and innovation information on different slides so you can use the Bootstrap navbar? Once you include your last image, try and put a description for your future innovation.                         |
| Damaris     | I liked your A-Frame creation. It's responsive and links are accurate.                                | Try adding in some context or an intro, and add some links to your navbar to jump to certain sections in your website.                                                                                                                                    |
| William     | I like how you put all the benefits right under each image.                                            | Have you considered decreasing the image size so it doesn’t fill about 70% of the page and block the information? Also, what would happen if someone swipes at the start and it flies off the page? The navbar also doesn't seem to work.               |
| Abdelrahman | I really, REALLY like the timeline! It looks sick and is informative.                                  | You should consider making the A-Frame smaller. It’s a 3D model you can move around, so it’s unnecessary to have to scroll to the side of the website to view it properly.                                                                                |
